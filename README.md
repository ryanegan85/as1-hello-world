# as1-hello-world
Assignment 1 for CS441, simple hello world app.

Program displays "Hello World" after clicking the button, and a counter on the bottom displays how many times you've clicked the button to make "Hello World" appear.

There is currently an issue where the animation only plays after the first click and no longer works after that.
